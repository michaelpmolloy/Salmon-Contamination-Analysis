# Salmon Contamination Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of contamination levels in farmed salmon from around the world. 

The analysis explores the levels on 9 different contaminants and aims to inform both consumers and businesses on regions which produce salmon with the least contaminants. This information is crucial to businesses and consumers as contamination levels in produce such as salmon vary in different regions relating to a regions historic use of different pesticides. 

The information in this analysis should provide insight into the best regions to source salmon from to reduce the harmful health effects of pesticides in produce. 

## Overview
The objective of this research is to identify the different degrees of contamination present in salmon from differen farmed globally. 

## Dataset 

## Analysis 
The “farmedSalmon.csv” data file contains the contamination profiles of 153 salmon from 8 different salmon farms located in Europe, North America and South America.The levels of nine contaminants Mirex, Hexachlorobenzene, HCH gamma, Heptachlor Epoxide, Dieldrin, Endrin, Chlordane, DDT and Dioxin are examined. The salmon samples originate from 8 salmon farms in Europe, North America and South America.

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is first applied to identify any trends between different salmon sources. A country based PCA shows significant overlap between countries of the same continent indicating a continent based PCA may be more suitable. 


A continent based PCA shows much better group separation therefore the following analysis is conducted comparing the contamination levels in different continents.

Density plots are used to examine the contamination levels present in the different continents.
